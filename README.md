# Secret-Santa
Every christmas, my friends and I have a tradition of playing secret santa, however during lockdown we were unable to pick names out of a hat. 
Therefore, I wrote this simple program to randomly assign each one of my friends to another person, ensuring that no one picks themselves.
The program was then sent to a friend who wasn't a part of the game, they ran the code and messaged everyone with the person they need to buy a gift for
And hence our tradition was saved!!
